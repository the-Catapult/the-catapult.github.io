## **Case Study 2: When Leadership Fails – Upholding Secularism in a Force**

Recently, Eid-ul-Fitr was celebrated across the world. This festival marks the end of a month-long fast observed by Muslims, abstaining from food and even water from dawn to dusk. Fasting during Ramadan is one of the five tenets of Islam and is followed with deep religious devotion. This holy month is dedicated to prayer and spiritual reflection. In predominantly Muslim countries, schools and offices adjust their schedules to accommodate religious practices, allowing people to break their fasts peacefully.

However, in India, where Muslims are a minority, such adjustments are not always feasible. Yet, as a secular nation, India upholds the right of every citizen to practice their faith freely. Nowhere is this secular fabric more evident than in the CRPF, the largest paramilitary force in the world. This Force brings together people from different states, religions, languages, and cultures, yet they work as one cohesive unit.

Not just on national occasions like Independence Day and Republic Day, but throughout the year, festivals such as Diwali, Holi, Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Pongal, and Baisakhi are celebrated with equal fervor in the Force. The Heads of Offices and Institutions play a crucial role in ensuring that this spirit of secularism is upheld, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and included.

But of late, I have noticed a troubling trend—some leaders are **failing in their duty** to maintain this balance. Their **biases have become so evident** that they can no longer be ignored. For instance, in a particular institution within this esteemed Force, festivals like Diwali, Holi, Pongal, and Swamy Ayyappa Puja were celebrated with meticulous planning. Meetings were held, committees were formed, and a considerable amount of money was sanctioned from the Welfare and Amenities Fund to make these celebrations grand. *However, when it came to Eid, there was complete indifference.*

Despite a significant number of personnel observing fasts while performing the arduous duties of the Force without a single complaint, their dedication did not seem to matter to those in charge. One particular institution, a training center housing over 1,500 recruits, had around 200 Muslim trainees—young men between 18 and 23 years old, away from home for the first time. It was natural for them to miss their families and the comforting taste of homemade *sewaiyyan* prepared by their mothers. While they understood the demands of their new life in uniform, *would it have been too much for the Head of the Institution to acknowledge their festival?*

> Why was there no planning for Eid? Why was no amount sanctioned from the Welfare Fund for its celebration? Why did the Head of Office fail to set a good example?

I later learned that Eid was indeed celebrated—not by any official initiative, but within the campus mosque, where Muslim personnel and recruits pooled their own money to ensure that those who came to pray could at least enjoy the traditional sweet dish. Unlike their Head of Institution, *they showed generosity and unity, upholding the values that true leadership should embody.*

They say the first experience leaves a lasting impression. What message did these new entrants receive about leadership? Instead of learning inclusivity and fairness, *they witnessed exclusion and indifference.*

> **A true leader never allows personal biases to cloud judgment.** Leadership demands impartiality, wisdom, and unwavering integrity. A leader must prioritize the welfare of their people, ensuring that every individual—regardless of faith—is treated with the same respect and consideration.

This incident is a reminder that secularism is not just a constitutional ideal but a **leadership responsibility**. If officers at the helm fail to uphold it, they risk eroding the very unity that makes the Force strong. Leadership training must emphasize not just operational efficiency but also the values of *inclusivity, fairness, and respect for all religions.* Because when leadership fails in these aspects, it sows seeds of division rather than solidarity—and that is a failure no Force can afford.

What is most disheartening in such cases is that *no action will be taken* against the Head of this Institution for such a glaring lapse. Even if an inquiry is ordered, it will be nothing more than an eyewash. Those in charge will walk away unscathed, while those who strive to uphold fairness will bear the consequences. The ones who try to ‘bell the cat’ will face harassment, career setbacks, and subtle but undeniable retribution. That is why nobody reports such incidents—because in a flawed system, *the truth is often punished*, and *silence becomes the only way to survive.*
