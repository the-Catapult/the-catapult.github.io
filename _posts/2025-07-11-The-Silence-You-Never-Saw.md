I gave *you* time I did not have,  
stretched my hours,  
bent my days,  
placed *your* storms above my own;  
not because it was easy,  
but because *you* mattered.  

I showed up,  
*again* and *again*,  
quietly,  
without applause,  
without telling you what it cost.  

You saw presence.  
You never saw the sacrifices —  
the dinners missed,  
the sleep lost,  
the aching heart I hid  
while holding yours steady.  

I juggled home and heartache,  
duties and devotion,  
carefully threading my world  
around your needs —  
because your pain felt urgent,  
and mine could wait.  

Not once did I speak  
of the balancing act  
that bruised me silently.  
Not once did I count  
the times I chose you  
over my own peace.  

I never wanted to measure love.  
I only hoped you’d feel it.  

But one day,  
you said *“I didn’t care”*.  
That my friendship wasn’t *real*.  

And something in me **cracked** —  
not from anger,  
but from the weight  
of being *unseen*.  

I don’t regret the giving.  
I never will.  
But it *hurts*  
to be misunderstood  
by the one with whom  

I always silently stood.
