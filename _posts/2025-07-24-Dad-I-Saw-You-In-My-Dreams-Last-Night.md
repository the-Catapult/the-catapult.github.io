Dad, I saw you in my dream last night,  
You entered the room, quiet as light.  
Where I was sleeping close to Mom,  
It was past midnight and near to morn.  

Mom woke me up, her voice was low,  
"There’s someone here; did you latch the door?"  
She saw your shape but didn’t know,  
In the dim light’s uncertain glow.  

But the instant I looked, I just knew,  
The figure in the room was you!  
I flung the sheets, rushed from bed,  
“Dad, Dad, Dad!” was all I said.  

I called out to you so many times,  
I asked you your whereabouts.  
But you just gave a silent glance,  
And continued to walk, like in a trance.  

You touched my handbag, don’t know why,  
Our eyes met in a silent goodbye.  
Out of the bedroom, through the main gate,  
You sat in the vehicle  
That silently waited at the gate.  

I cried aloud, “Dad, where were you?”  
But you moved away, as if you knew.  
I wanted to run, to follow and see,  
But Mom held me back, wouldn't set me free.  

I saw the pain so deep in your eyes,  
A sorrow only I could recognize.  
A lump in my throat began to rise,  
Then burst in a flood through my eyes.  

Why didn’t you stop? Why no reply?  
Why did you leave without goodbye?  
Did you come to tell me something true,  
Or were you missing your ‘Laddu’ too?  

Why did Mom hold me back last night?  
I couldn't free her grip, try as I might,  
You had to leave again all alone,  
This thought chills me to the bone.  

I wish you'd paused and held out your hand,  
Taken me with you to that distant land.  
We'd dance again, our rock 'n' roll,  
Like good ol’ times ; pure joy, pure gold.  

I know I failed you, time and again,  
That guilt still burns, a silent pain.  
If I could go back, I’d make things right,  
Erase the wrongs, fill you with delight.  

I’ve asked your grandson, your little gem,  
To build a time machine, just for his mom.  
Like in those sci-fi films we see,  
So we could meet, just you and me.  

Bless him, Dad, from wherever you are,  
From the heaven above, a world so far.  
So we can laugh, and sing, and dance,  
And I could ride on your back once more,  
Like the little girl you carried before.  

I miss you, Dad… more than I know,  
Your visit in my dream, a proof that shows.  
A surreal bond, that can't displace,  
A love like ours… time can't erase.
