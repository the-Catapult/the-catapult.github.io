The world is celebrating Father's Day today,  
Yet it feels like a quiet, modest display.  
When compared to Mother's Day’s warm array,  
Or the grand, loud cheer of Women's Day.  

The moment he learns he’s going to be a dad,  
His heart soars high, uncontained, so glad.  
But beneath the joy lies a quiet fear—  
Will he be enough? Will he be able to steer,  
His roles and duties with strength and grace,  
And never let his child see doubt on his face.  

He adores the woman who bears his child,  
His love for her tender, deep, and wild.  
And when he sees his newborn for the first time,  
His heart melts—pure, raw, and sublime.  
All his fears dissolve, And resolves take flight,  
He vows to raise his child just right.  

He learns to cradle dreams in tired hands,  
To juggle bills, hopes, and multiple errands.  
Often unthanked, he walks the miles,  
Hiding many a silent worries,  
Behind a grim face or silent smiles...  

He does not always voice his pain,  
Or seek applause, or look for fame—  
But in the depth of his tired eyes,  
Lie a countless unsung yesterdays.  

When his child stumbles, he supports with his might,  
Yet, he steps back slowly, And lets his child fight—  
To learn, to Win and to grow,  
A quiet strength that only fathers show.  

He hides his tears, so we feel brave,  
His scoldings are gentle yet grave.  
Not always perfect, not always right,  
But always there— like a guiding light.  

So friends let us lift a toast today,  
To all the fathers who show us the way—  
Not with boisterity, not with flair,  
But with consistence, patience and great care.
