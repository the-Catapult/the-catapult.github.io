International Women's Day was celebrated on March 8th with great fervor across the country. In some places, the enthusiasm even escalated into a frenzy, with business houses and the beauty and cosmetic industries eagerly cashing in on this newfound fad.

Women were felicitated for their contributions, politicians used the occasion to woo women voters, and social media was flooded with messages glorifying women's resilience, multitasking abilities, and sacrifices. Offices hosted celebrations‚Äîparties were thrown, cakes were cut, bouquets and gifts were distributed, and women-centric games and activities were organized. And then? The day ended, and everything went back to how it was before.

Amid all the noise, the real essence of Women's Day was lost. Few seemed to remember why this day exists in the first place‚Äîthe struggles of American women who fought for equal rights, better working conditions, and fair wages. It was their fight that laid the foundation for the rights and opportunities women have today.

Yet, after all the grand celebrations, I wonder‚Äîhas anything really changed?

Will there be no more rapes? No more brides burned for dowry? No more unborn girls silenced before they take their first breath? Will a woman in India finally be able to step out alone at night and feel safe?

In a country where:

- A woman‚Äôs accidentally visible bra strap makes men shift uncomfortably in their seats‚Ä¶
- Menstrual periods are spoken about in hushed tones, as if they were something shameful‚Ä¶
- A woman choosing her own clothes can be enough to label her an attention seeker‚Ä¶

Can we really say we are celebrating women? Or are we just indulging in a one-day spectacle, conveniently ignoring the everyday struggles that remain unchanged?

## Who is Responsible?

But enough of pointing out the problems and de-glorifying the male species, as if they alone are responsible for making India unsafe for women. **O' Womaniya, who is responsible for this?**

Look within. **We are!**

Now, don‚Äôt gawk at me. It‚Äôs time for us, as women, to acknowledge our role in shaping the world we live in. We are the ones who bring the male species into this world (yes, with a little contribution from them‚Äîa single cell so microscopic that it‚Äôs 60 thousandths of a centimeter long!). And in India, the upbringing of a child‚Äîespecially in their most impressionable years‚Äîis largely in the hands of the mother.

So, let‚Äôs ask ourselves: **Are we raising our sons to respect women? Are we leading by example?**

If you allow yourself to be disrespected by your spouse, chances are your son will grow up believing that it‚Äôs acceptable to disrespect women.

We must teach our boys, from a young age, that women are their equals‚Äînot objects of fascination or control.

- Let your son buy sanitary pads for his sister or cousin. He should be able to walk into a shop and ask for them as confidently as he would for any other medical necessity.
- We hush our girls into hiding their bras and underwear, but instead, we should be teaching our sons that these are just articles of clothing‚Äînothing to be ashamed of, nothing to ogle at.

The more we conceal, the more we create forbidden curiosities. I‚Äôm not saying one should dress or behave without modesty, but we must teach our boys that **a woman‚Äôs body is not an object of temptation‚Äîit is hers**. They must learn to accept **No** as an answer, without entitlement or resentment.

Because there have been far too many instances where a love-smitten boy couldn‚Äôt take no for an answer‚Äîso he molested, raped, or threw acid on a girl‚Äôs face, scarring her for life.

## Strength Beyond Physicality

In response, we have started training girls in martial arts, empowering them to defend themselves. After all, in India, Goddess Durga is worshipped as the embodiment of **Shakti**‚Äîstrength and power.

Yet, it is equally true that femininity is not a weakness; it is her strength.

And if a girl is unable to train in martial arts or build physical strength, she should not be made to feel inadequate. **Her worth is not measured by her ability to fight but by her spirit and resilience.**

She should not be confined within four walls or constantly chaperoned, simply because society deems her the 'weaker sex'!

Why can't we see that girls are like *butterflies and flowers*‚Äîbringing color and fragrance to this world‚Ä¶

*She is like music and the fine arts‚Äîsoothing, ethereal, and deeply moving. She may appear delicate, but her emotional strength is unmatched.*

So why should she be forced to put on a man‚Äôs boots‚Äîjust because some men were never taught how to control their raging hormones or respect the other gender?

## The Balance We Must Create

The beauty of this world lies in the perfect balance between men and women. **And we, as women, have the power to shape that balance.**

Let us pay more attention to how we raise our sons. Let‚Äôs not distance them as they grow into teenagers and adults. Studies show that boys who experience warmth and affection from their mothers‚Äîwho are hugged, embraced, and nurtured‚Äîgrow into better men. 

So let‚Äôs not hesitate to hold our sons close, to teach them the right and wrong in life, to give them bear hugs and a kiss on the forehead.

And most importantly‚Äî**let‚Äôs not tolerate injustice toward ourselves**. Let‚Äôs be the role models our sons and daughters can look up to.

**O‚Äô Womaniya, let it not just be the 8th of March‚Äîevery day is a tribute to you!** üíêüíê
