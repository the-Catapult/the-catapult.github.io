Realization about the term fantasy
Came to me in my teenage.
I fantasized a lot those days,
And one of my favourite fantasies was
Getting shipwrecked on an island.

I would dream of being the lone survivor,
All alone on an unknown land,
Where only some tribe lived—
They didn’t know my language,
And I didn’t know theirs.

With signs and sounds we spoke,
A silent dialogue of gestures and glances.
In my world, they were kind-hearted souls,
No threat, no cannibals—just curious smiles.

Perhaps I was inspired by Tarzan,
A jungle boy guiding me through
Waterfalls, secret caves, and moonlit beaches,
Treating me like a princess of the wild.

Time passed; life pulled me into its whirlpool,
But still the fantasy lingered.
Now I imagined getting shipwrecked again,
This time with a few close friends—
A strange tragedy we turned into an adventure.

We laughed under starlit skies,
Feasted on fruits, built fires, sang songs,
Until one day, a ship on the horizon
Called us back to the world we left behind.

The fantasy endured through years,
Never realized, yet never gone—
A quiet tenant in the closet of my mind.
The faces changed with time,
But the island stayed the same.

Now, I dream of being marooned again,
But with my close-knit family—
No gadgets, no buzzing phones,
Just us and nature, unfiltered and whole.

I imagine using all I’ve learned—
Herbs for healing, leaves for shelter,
Feeding my family from forest and sea,
A life simple, yet rich in meaning.

We’d stay long enough to feel reborn,
Until seafarers spot us one day,
Waving joyfully, yet hesitantly,
As we leave our fantasy behind.

They say fantasies are unfulfilled desires,
Perhaps that’s true…
I wonder, if ever it comes true,
Who will be with me—
Living the dream I’ve nurtured all along?
