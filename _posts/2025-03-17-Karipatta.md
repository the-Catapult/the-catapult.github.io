# Mumbai Diaries: Chapter 4


On my transfer to Navi Mumbai, finding a flat to live in was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish. The ones I liked were exorbitantly out of my budget. The ones that were affordable, I didn’t like. After a lot of searching and hunting around, when I finally found one that felt a bit comfortable, the house owner refused to rent it to me—once he saw my Aadhar card. *Phew!*

Yes, it was my name on the card that gave it away. It clearly denoted that I was a **Muslim**.

> *And whoever said, "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet!"—please, please take back your words! There’s too much in a name! If I were not a Khan but a Sharma, Singh, or Patel, I would have faced far less discrimination.*

The house owner did not want tenants from my religion. I won’t blame them if they felt this way. The events in the country and the world over the past few decades have tarnished the image of this peace-loving religion to such an extent that anyone belonging to the **Muslim** community—or even someone sporting a beard or wearing a kurta-pyjama—is viewed with suspicion. A lot of the credit for spreading this negative image also goes to popular films, where every terrorist is conveniently portrayed to look the same way.

Finally, after a lot of searching and negotiations with the broker, I found a flat—though it was located almost on the outskirts of the city limits. I could now fully empathize with the people in the olden days who belonged to the so-called **lower castes**. They were not allowed to live within the mainstream village area. Their huts were placed at the outskirts, far away from the privileged.

I too felt like an outcast, pushed far from the heart of Navi Mumbai.

But they say adversities come with their own advantages, and I found some too. Since there were no shops nearby, there was **less pollution, less noise, and more fresh air** and unhindered sunlight in my room. I also had a nice large **balcony**—a luxury by any standard in a metro like Mumbai.

This building in Navi Mumbai was, by and large, occupied mostly by people from the **Muslim** community. Probably, they too had faced problems like me and had eventually been pushed to the city's outskirts in search of accommodation.

I was lucky enough to have good neighbors—in a city where, they say, nobody usually knows or even bothers to know who lives next door. One Sunday, when I was at home, my neighbors introduced me to their house owner. She was an elderly lady, probably in her early seventies, well-built, wearing a housecoat with her head covered by a dupatta—a typical sign that she was also a **Muslim**.

I have always been good at striking a chord with the elderly. Soon, she was seated in my flat, sharing her life story.

She was originally from **Gujarat** but had moved to Mumbai with her sons after her husband’s demise. She fondly recalled, with a sweet laugh, how in her younger days, whenever she wore a saree and went out, she would often be mistaken for a **Patel** lady (*a Hindu community in Gujarat*). She also reminisced about the good old days when people didn’t differentiate based on religion. Most of her neighbors in Gujarat were **Hindus**, and they always came forward to help whenever her ailing husband needed medical care.

Her eyes held a **forlorn look** as she continued.

She spoke of how, during **Eid**, her Hindu neighbors relished her **sewaiyan** (*sweet dish*), and she, in turn, loved celebrating **Diwali** with them. There was a time when no one saw any difference. But in the past decade or so, the **divide between communities** had visibly grown—thanks to the political climate of the country.

She was saddened by the plight of **poor Muslims in Uttar Pradesh**, suffering under various state policies. It pained her to see how, during the **Kumbh Mela**, one of the largest human congregations on earth, **Muslim boatmen** and other petty workers were denied the opportunity to ferry pilgrims or sell their goods—robbing them of their legitimate livelihood, simply because they were Muslim.

> *“The nation has forgotten the contributions of this community,” she sighed. “We chose India as our motherland. We stayed back in this country. And yet…”*

After exchanging pleasantries and promising to meet again soon, she left. But long after she was gone, her words lingered in my mind. I wished for the return of those **good old days**—of **bonhomie, communal harmony, and peace**.

But enough of serious talk! Let me tell you about a **funny incident** that happened between me and my neighbor.

The other day, I decided to make some **poha** (*a dish made of flattened rice*). I had all the ingredients—except **karipatta** (*curry leaves*). Being from **South India**, I loved the flavor of these leaves in most of my cooking. You simply **cannot** make **sambar, rasam, or vegetable stir-fries** without them. **Karipatta** is an inevitable ingredient in **South Indian cuisine**.

What was I to do? I decided to ask my neighbor if she had some.

**Knock-knock!**

She answered the door, and I asked if she had **karipatta**. She went to her kitchen and came back with… a bunch of **green coriander**!

I smiled and said, “No, I need **karipatta**.” But she didn’t have any. Most people would have left it at that. But **not her!** She was determined to help me find **karipatta**. She rushed off to her friend’s flat on the opposite side to check if she had some. Within a minute, she was back, proudly clutching a few twigs of **karipatta** in her hand!

I thanked her profusely and went back to my kitchen, happy to start cooking.

But just as I got busy, **knock-knock!**

I opened the door to find my neighbor standing there, looking **perplexed—almost terrified**.

In her rush to fetch **karipatta** for me, she had left her door **open**. A gust of wind had slammed it shut, **locking her out!** And she didn’t have her keys. Her **husband and sons** would be home soon, and she had to finish cooking before they arrived!

She started **panicking**.

I immediately grabbed my flat keys and tried to open her door, but it wouldn’t budge. No amount of twisting and turning the handle worked. The **tension mounted**.

Finally, we decided she would **cross over the half-wall** separating our balconies. It was risky—one small misstep and she could **crash to the ground**. But we had no other option.

I tried lifting her up, but she was wearing a **silky kurta**, and every time I hoisted her, she’d **slip back**. Despite the tension, we **burst out laughing** each time she failed.

Somehow, I managed to heave her up. Now she was perched on the wall—**one leg dangling on each side**—looking like a **cat on a fence!**

With a deep breath, she finally swung her other leg over and jumped. **Thud!** No bones broken—**mission accomplished!**

That night, as I ate my **poha**, I carefully **removed the karipatta** before taking a bite.

Yes, this leaf gives so much **aroma and flavor** to a dish. But once its essence is extracted, it is discarded, **pushed aside, no longer needed**.

> *And suddenly, it struck me.*
>
> *The situation of Muslims in this country today is slowly becoming like that of **karipatta**…*
