In search of that …ship  
Where I feel at ease,  
Where I can simply be,  
And lay my truths, unjudged.  

Where no routines confine me,  
Where absence is not offense,  
I’m welcomed back with warmth,  
No questions, no pretense.  

No grudges held, no grumbles aired,  
No guilt to cloud the air,  
Just comfort in the silence,  
Just knowing someone’s there.  

Whenever I’m aboard this …ship,  
There must be sheer joy—and yes,  
That ‘no strings attached’ relationship  

Which is called “Friendship”.  

But in this world which is selfish,  
So quick to judge, so tight the grip,  
Where caring could seem foolish,  
Where do I find such a ….ship?
