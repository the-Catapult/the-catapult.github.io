As a tired autumn gives way to much awaited spring,  
New energy and life to the trees they bring  
The branches that once stood almost naked,  
Are now decked up in shiny green blanket  
New leaves and fronds in vibrant colours,  
*Oh they soothe the eyes and soul together*  

A look at the colourful hues of the flowers  
Adorning the trees with such beauty and class,  
Even the saddest heart forgets its gloom  
When it sees the spring in its full bloom  

Whoever planted trees on the city's roadside,  
*My heart reveres you with ah, so much pride,*  
There could be no better service to mankindâ€”  
**Mumbai City dwellers bow to you for this lifeline...**
